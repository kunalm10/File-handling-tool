# File-handling-tool

•Data filtering is a big hurdle when we have thousands of files to work with. In one of my project, I was supposed to work with thousands of video files required for testing purpose.
•Often search bar isn’t good enough by itself to search the required files.
•Wouldn’t it be great if we can tell the computer about all the files you want to see to be listed in an Excel Sheet just by giving in some parameters.
•The parameters selected here are ‘creation date’, ‘file name’, and ‘creation time’.
•Hence, this motivated me to create a program which performs exactly like described above.
