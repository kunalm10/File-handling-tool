# File-handling-tool

This program helps in searching and organizing large datasets with much ease rather than using conventional OS search operations.

This tool is specifically made to handle lots of images or videos present in a directory.

## Description
The program starts with displaying GUI input windows created using Tkinter. It asks for user requirements like, file name, date created or time created. 
When user inputs that, it looks for all the matching cases in the directory.

The program returns a excel sheet with the matching results and the hyperlinks to those matching files. 

## How to use
Save the python script in the same parent directory where all the files are present.
Run the script and provide the input parameters. Once done, you can see the results saved in a excel sheet generated by the code.
